# 🗣 Python Voice Assistant

A fun and simple voice assistant developed entirely in Python. This project uses speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user via voice commands. It can perform basic tasks like telling the time, opening websites, searching on Google, and more.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎧 Listens to your voice commands
- 🗣 Responds using text-to-speech
- ⏰ Tells the current time and date
- 🌐 Opens websites like Google, YouTube, etc.
- 🔍 Performs Google searches
- ✨ Easy to customize and extend with new commands

## 💪 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- speech_recognition
- pyttsx3
- datetime
- webbrowser
- os

## 🛆 Installation

1. *Clone the repository:*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant-python.git
   cd voice-assistant-python
   

2. *Install the dependencies:*

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. *Run the assistant:*

   bash
   python main.py
   

## 📁 Project Structure

## 💡 How It Works

The assistant listens to the user’s voice input, processes it with speech_recognition, and performs actions accordingly. It uses pyttsx3 to give voice responses.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add weather information
- Control system apps (e.g., open notepad, calculator)
- Add reminders and notes
- Support for more voice commands

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Python community and the developers of the open-source libraries used in this project!
